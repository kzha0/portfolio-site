# Projects
<br />

### Oli-Order
September 2024 — ongoing development<br/>
- An order management system implementation for Papi Oli, a popular restobar in The Pop Up, Katipunan, Q.C.
- This project includes a mobile order-taking web app, flexible database backend with a customizable food and beverage menu, and a print server for WiFi/LAN thermal printers that can be deployed anywhere
- Uses budget thermal printers from XPrinter company to cut equipment costs by over 85% (from a PHP 14,000 EPSON unit down to a PHP 2,000 XPrinter unit)
- Drastically reduces waiters' motion waste and reduces order lead time by approx. 1 minute and 14 seconds
- Started as a capstone research project during my 4th year in college
<br />

### [Deno-bindgen 2](https://github.com/kzha0/deno-bindgen2)
August 2024 — on hold since November 2024<br/>
- A niche tool that automatically generates TypeScript/JavaScript code for consuming Foreign Function Interface (FFI) libraries from Rust for the Deno runtime
- This tool makes it easier for JS/TS developers to use powerful libraries from a memory-safe language like Rust without having to learn the complexities of the language itself
- Can reduce tech debt in polyglot projects that includes Rust as a programming language
- This can also make the adoption of Rust easier for a project
- Started out of a need in one of my projects
- Rewritten from the official [deno-bindgen](https://github.com/denoland/deno_bindgen) project which has been unmaintained for a long time
- Multiple technical improvements over the original project, including:
    - Optimized code generation and build process
    - Better developer ergonomics using Rust macros
    - More efficient source code parser
    - Expanded support for data structuress
    - Support for user-defined types/structs
    - Abstraction for Rust types into TypeScript
    - Finer control over code generation options in the CLI
