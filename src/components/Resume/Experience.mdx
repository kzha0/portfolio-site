# Projects

### Oli-Order
*November 2024 — ongoing development*
- An order management system for restaurants and food & beverage businesses
- Started as a capstone research project during my 4th year in college, in partnership with Papi Oli, a popular restobar in the Pop Up, Katipunan, Q.C.
- This project includes:
    - Mobile web app for taking orders
    - Dashboard for viewing orders, managing employees, and editing the menu
    - Backend database server written in Rust
    - Print server made specifically for the budget XPrinter thermal printer
- Cuts equipment costs by over 85% (from a PHP 14,000 EPSON unit down to a PHP 2,000 XPrinter unit)
- Reduces waiters' motion waste and order lead time by approx. 1 minute and 14 seconds

### [Deno-bindgen 2](https://github.com/kzha0/deno-bindgen2)
*August 2024 — on hold since November 2024*
- A niche tool that automatically generates TypeScript/JavaScript code for consuming Foreign Function Interface (FFI) libraries from Rust for the Deno runtime
- This tool makes it easier for JS/TS developers to use powerful libraries from a memory-safe language like Rust without having to learn the complexities of the language itself
- Can reduce tech debt in polyglot projects that includes Rust as a programming language
- This can also make the adoption of Rust easier for a project
- Started out of a need in one of my projects
- Rewritten from the official [deno-bindgen](https://github.com/denoland/deno_bindgen) project which has been unmaintained for a long time
- Multiple technical improvements over the original project, including:
    - Optimized code generation and build process
    - Better developer ergonomics using Rust macros
    - More efficient source code parser
    - Expanded support for data structures
    - Support for user-defined types/structs
    - Abstraction for Rust types into TypeScript
    - Finer control over code generation options in the CLI
